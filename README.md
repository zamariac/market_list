#Market_List#

Because I want to take advantage of what produce the seasons have to offer, and I never want to miss that one weekend when ramps are in stock! 

With Market list I will be able to peruse various farmers markets and see what individual vendors are bringing that day, compare prices and hopefully taste those sun golds everyone has been raving out! 

Vendors will be able to easily input their weekends stock, price and availability and bring in more customers looking for specific items!
